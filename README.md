## Project Overviews



### TypeScript Practice: Hotel Management System

The **HotelsManagmentSystem** project is a TypeScript-based hotel reservation system. This project covers:

- **OOP and TypeScript Interfaces**: Separate classes for `Room`, `Hotel`, `Guest`, and `Reservation`.
- **Type Safety**: Strongly typed interfaces for data integrity.
- **Functional Requirements**: Room management, reservation handling, and revenue tracking.

Please refer to the [README](https://github.com/kasiabanas/QA-Tester/blob/main/README.md) in the `HotelsManagmentSystem` folder for setup instructions and detailed specifications.

### Playwright Test Example TODO:

The **Playwright_Test** folder contains a Playwright test script automating a user login scenario. This project demonstrates:

- **User Action Simulation**: Filling out login forms and navigating.
- **Assertion of Expected Outcomes**: Ensuring successful login functionality.
- **Flexible Setup**: Playwright configuration for test customization.

Refer to the [README](./Playwright_Test/README.md) in the `Playwright_Test` folder for setup instructions and specifications.
